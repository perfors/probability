# probability

This contains data and analysis for the probability distribution paper.

The raw data can be found in the `ExperimentN_Andy.csv` files.

The Rmd files with `creation` in them are used to perform model fits. The corresponding html files explain what is in them and where to find their output. 

The files with all of the analyses and figures are the `dataanalysis` ones. They are fairly self-explanatory. 

The Rmd file `plausibility` reports the parameter analysis for our data (to what extent they are recoverable). The one for `robustness` explores to what extent the parameters are recoverable in general, for a wide variety of possible priors.
